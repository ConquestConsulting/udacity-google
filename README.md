## Course intro

*Chaitra Ramanathan and Nick Blumenthal, Udacity scholarship program managers*

* There were >100K applicants.
* They selected 50K "passionate, motivated, and resilient scholars." I think this was for the entire program. The intermediate web developer section has 10K people.
* Three months to complete the challenge course (ends on April 11, 2018).
* Six month follow-up course awarded based on "progress and performance in this initial three month challenge course, as well as your contributions to the student community." Participation is important. Use forum and Slack.
