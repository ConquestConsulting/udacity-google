* Found out about the Grow with Google scholarship via Udacity's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Udacity/posts/1250067568431912) and [Medium](https://medium.com/udacity/grow-with-google-50-000-new-scholarships-available-now-1aa0513430b6) posts, while on a bus to NYC for the [New York Coffee Festival](https://www.newyorkcoffeefestival.com/) on October 14, 2017.
* [Applied](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-google/blob/master/udacity-google-00-apply.md) in December 2017.
* Won the scholarship in January 2018!
