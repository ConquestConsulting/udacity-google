## Background

This repository contains notes and resources from the [Udacity Grow with Google](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google) Scholarship challenge course, in the Intermediate Web Developer track.

The [Grow with Google scholarship program](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google) is an initiative designed to help people make career changes into coding. I was accepted to the intermediate web developer track to learn techniques for building progressive web apps. There was a three month challenge round, after which the top participants move on to a more advanced Mobile Web Specialist program.

Here's how it went down:

- Found out about the Grow with Google scholarship via Udacity's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Udacity/posts/1250067568431912) and [Medium](https://medium.com/udacity/grow-with-google-50-000-new-scholarships-available-now-1aa0513430b6) posts, while on a bus to NYC for the [New York Coffee Festival](https://www.newyorkcoffeefestival.com/) on October 14, 2017.
- [Applied](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-google/blob/master/udacity-google-00-apply.md) in December 2017.
- Won the scholarship in January 2018!
