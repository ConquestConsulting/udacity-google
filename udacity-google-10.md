## Program feedback

I was really pumped when I got this scholarship. And even more pumped when I started the lessons.

**I enjoyed the introduction to progressive web apps (PWAs)**. I think about PWAs every time I look at my phone. I regularly prune my app collection to remove anything I don't use, but my Google Pixel XL still currently has >150 apps. That seems like too many. I think we are over-dependent on native apps. Native apps have their place, but have reduced the openness of the web and created clutter on our mobile devices. The future seems like it's going to be in blurring the line between websites and apps. I'm excited to be surfing the next wave of PWAs!

The **timing** was challenging. When the Grow with Google challenge course began, I had been working through the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program (FSND). I was a a little bit stressed about the time limit on the challenge course, and about how to budget my time between the two programs. However, with the help of my Udacity FSND mentor, I came up with an effective approach. I worked up to a good pause point in the FSND, then worked through the Grow with Google materials, finishing over a month ahead of the deadline, and then got back to the FSND.

Another challenging aspect for me was the **participation**. Social media can be distracting. It took me a little while to warm up to the forums and Slack, but I was glad I did. Two positive outcomes of the social networking were **meetups** and **pomodoros**. I got to meet up with some fellow Udacious humans in Boston. I also learned about the pomodoro technique. It's like interval training for working, and really helped me get through the course materials efficiently. My participation not only helped me, but the other students as well. I took detailed notes on the course materials and shared them on [GitHub](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-google). Other students appreciated the organized, thorough notes. I also put together a [guide to writing with Markdown](md.md) to help other students maximize their documentation.

Thanks Udacity and Google!
